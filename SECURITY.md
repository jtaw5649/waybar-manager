## Security Considerations

### Module Installation
- Modules are downloaded from GitHub repositories
- Users should review module source code before installation
- Waybar Manager merges module configs into your waybar configuration
- Scripts included in modules are made executable and run by waybar

### Network Security
- All API communication uses HTTPS
- Registry API is hosted on Cloudflare Workers
- No authentication data is stored locally

### Local Data
- Configuration files are stored in `~/.config/waybar/`
- Module data is stored in `~/.local/share/waybar-manager/`
- Cache is stored in `~/.cache/waybar-manager/`
